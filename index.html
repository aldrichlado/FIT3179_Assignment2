          <h2>Average salary and rating in different cities</h2>
          <p>
            Different cities have different living cost and economic standards, this should be visible in the average salary difference as higher living cost almost always mean that
            higher salary is also expected. Knowing this, we want to see the average salary of Data Science Jobs in some big cities in Australia and see which cities actually
            have a higher average salary.
            <br></br>
            From the proportional symbol map, we can see that Sydney has the highest average salary as it has the largest area channel with an average salary of <strong>$107,000</strong>. 
            This is appropriate as the living cost in Sydney is actually the most expensive out of all cities in Australia. Adelaide and Perth are the next in line with around <strong>$98,000</strong> average salary per year.
            Melbourne is actually in the 4th place with an average salary of just around <strong>$92,000</strong> per year. This is surprising as melbourne is the city with the second most expensive living cost in Australia.
            <br></br>
            We also want to see which city has the best companies to work for by looking at the average company rating per city in Australia. After knowing which city
            has the best rating given by their employees or previous employees, we also would like to compare how the average salary can probably affect the average rating
            of the companies.
            <br></br>
            We can see that the city with the biggest average company rating is Sydney with an average rating of 4. We can also see that the city with the smallest average company rating is Gold Coast.
            Coincidentally, Sydney also has the biggest average salary and Gold Coast also has the least average salary which means that there might be a correlation between salary and company rating.

          <h2>Required Skills for Data Science Jobs</h2>
          <p>Data science is a growing field in the industry which is growing very rapidly and more popular by the day, this means that the job requirements does not come easily and some skills are needed in order to
            get a job in the field of Data Science. Some of those relevant skills nowadays consist of <strong>python, r, and tableau</strong>. We want to see which cities that has those requirements to apply for the 
            data science jobs in the company.
            <br></br>
            The visualised data is given as an isotype where each image represents 5 companies requiring those skills per 100 companies that are listed. We can see very clearly that python is the skill that most company
            has as their requirement to the job, followed closely by R. Tableau is also needed in some companies but it is not as important as the other two as they have less requirements than the others.
            We can also see that the companies requiring these skills are mostly companies in big cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, this may be because they are bigger companies which needs more automation to handle larger data.
