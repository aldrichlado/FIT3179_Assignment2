          <h2>Average salary and rating in different cities</h2>
          <p>
            Different cities have different living cost and economic standards, this should be visible in the average salary difference as higher living cost almost always mean that
            higher salary is also expected. Knowing this, we want to see the average salary of Data Science Jobs in some big cities in Australia and see which cities actually
            have a higher average salary.
            <br></br>
            From the proportional symbol map, we can see that Sydney has the highest average salary as it has the largest area channel with an average salary of <strong>$107,000</strong>. 
            This is appropriate as the living cost in Sydney is actually the most expensive out of all cities in Australia. Adelaide and Perth are the next in line with around <strong>$98,000</strong> average salary per year.
            Melbourne is actually in the 4th place with an average salary of just around <strong>$92,000</strong> per year. This is surprising as melbourne is the city with the second most expensive living cost in Australia.
            <br></br>
            We also want to see which city has the best companies to work for by looking at the average company rating per city in Australia. After knowing which city
            has the best rating given by their employees or previous employees, we also would like to compare how the average salary can probably affect the average rating
            of the companies.
            <br></br>
            We can see that the city with the biggest average company rating is Sydney with an average rating of 4. We can also see that the city with the smallest average company rating is Gold Coast.
            Coincidentally, Sydney also has the biggest average salary and Gold Coast also has the least average salary which means that there might be a correlation between salary and company rating.

          <h2>Required Skills for Data Science Jobs</h2>
          <p>Data science is a growing field in the industry which is growing very rapidly and more popular by the day, this means that the job requirements does not come easily and some skills are needed in order to
            get a job in the field of Data Science. Some of those relevant skills nowadays consist of <strong>python, r, and tableau</strong>. We want to see which cities that has those requirements to apply for the 
            data science jobs in the company.
            <br></br>
            The visualised data is given as an isotype where each image represents 5 companies requiring those skills per 100 companies that are listed. We can see very clearly that python is the skill that most company
            has as their requirement to the job, followed closely by R. Tableau is also needed in some companies but it is not as important as the other two as they have less requirements than the others.
            We can also see that the companies requiring these skills are mostly companies in big cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, this may be because they are bigger companies which needs more automation to handle larger data.

          <h2>Relationship Between Company's Different Attributes</h2>
          <p>
            Company are measured using different attribute on a scale from 0 to 5. We have 4 attributes including the carrer opportunities, culture and values, work life balance and compensation and benefits. 
            <br></br>
            We can see that carrer opportunities are somewhat negatively correlated to culture and values, this makes sense because they have more ways to create opportunities and does not have to stick to predefined culture.
            We can also see that the company culture and values are positively correlated to work life balance which can be caused by the company having a great structure and not requiring employees to work overtime.
            Lastly, there is somewhat a postive trend between having a low work life balance to a higher compensation and benefits, this can be interpreted as compensation is taken as a reward from the companies to all of the employees that have sacrificed their time and doing more work
            by going overtime and losing their work-life balance.

          <h2>Correlation between company rating on reccomendation and compensation</h2>
          <p>
            We want to see the proportion of the types of Data Science jobs that are available in the market as an employee or future employee. 
            We can see that the biggest proportion of jobs available are title for a Data Scientist with more than half of the job available being in that section.
            If a brushing is done where we choose the companies with ratings greater than 3 and compensation level greater than 3, still more than half of the jobs are titled for a data scientist.
            On the other hand, when we choose the companies with ratings less than 3 and compensation level less than 3, We can see that majority of the job is titled as a data analyst.
            Therefore, we can conclude that a job as a data scientist is more fulfiling and offers better compensation towards their employee than a job as a data analyst.

            The word map is created to see the words that appeared in the job title. This is done to know the key words that might be needed for potential employees to search for when looking for a job in a data science related job.
            We can see that the word that occured the most is Data which is not surprising at all, followed closely by scientist. There are also some word that does not seem to have anything to do
